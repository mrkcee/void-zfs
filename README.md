# void-zfs
Set of fish shell scripts that I use to help me setup and install Void Linux in a ZFS filesystem. The configuration is very specific to my use case.

These scripts were based on eoli3n's void config scripts (https://github.com/eoli3n/void-config).

## Numbering
00 - Preparation of disks and partitions, creation of zpools and datasets

01 - Installation of Void Linux and setup of ZFSBootMenu

99 - Small utility scripts that are used for recovery and maintenance
