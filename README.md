# void-zfs
Set of shell scripts that I used to help me setup and install Void Linux in a ZFS filesystem. The configuration is very specific to my use case.

These scripts were based on eoli3n's void config scripts (https://github.com/eoli3n/void-config).

00 - Preparation of disks and partitions, creation of zpools and datasets
01 - Installation of Void Linux and setup of ZFSBootMenu
99 - Small scripts that used for recovery and maintenance
